# Remote-Floating-Trash-Sweeper-Water-Quality-Analyzer

This repository contains the source code and design files for a remote-controlled floating trash sweeper that also analyzes water quality. The device collects litter from water surfaces and uses pH and turbidity sensors to assess contamination levels. The system connects to a mobile app for control and data management and includes a rechargeable battery with a solar power option.
