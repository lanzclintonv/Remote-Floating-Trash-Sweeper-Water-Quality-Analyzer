# Remote-Floating-Trash-Sweeper-Water-Quality-Analyzer

This repository contains the source code and design files for a remote-controlled floating trash sweeper that also analyzes water quality. The device collects litter from water surfaces and uses pH and turbidity sensors to assess contamination levels. The system connects to a mobile app for control and data management and includes a rechargeable battery with a solar power option.

This repository contains the following essential files to help you set up and understand the project:

AIA File: This file can be imported into MIT App Inventor to manage and modify the project files, enabling you to easily edit the app's design and functionality.

INO File: This file contains the Arduino code for the hardware component of the project, which you can upload to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.

Schematic Diagram: A visual representation of the hardware connections and components is provided as an image file, offering a clear understanding of how the hardware is set up.

APK File: This Android app installer package allows you to directly install and test the app on your Android device, simplifying the process of evaluating the app's performance and functionality.

Blocks.png: This image file contains a visual representation of the block code used in MIT App Inventor, helping you better understand the logic and flow of the app's functionality.
